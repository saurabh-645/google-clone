# Google - Clone Project

## Description

This project is a front-end implementation of Google's search functionalities, including Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. The project is part of the CS50W course and aims to mimic the interface and behavior of Google's search pages. Users can perform searches directly from the custom front-end, which interacts with Google's search engine using GET parameters.

## Features

- **Google Search Page**: 
  - Allows users to type a query and click "Google Search" to be taken to the Google search results page.
  - Includes an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that takes users directly to the first search result, bypassing the search results page.
  - Links to Google Image Search and Google Advanced Search in the upper-right corner.

- **Google Image Search Page**: 
  - Users can type a query and click the search button to be taken to the Google Image search results for that query.
  - Includes a link in the upper-right corner to go back to the main Google Search page.

- **Google Advanced Search Page**: 
  - Provides input fields for four search options:
    - "all these words"
    - "this exact word or phrase"
    - "any of these words"
    - "none of these words"
  - The Advanced Search button is styled similarly to Google's, with a blue background and white text.
  - Includes a link in the upper-right corner to return to the main Google Search page.
